Coq Minimal Emacs Setup

Sick and tired of bullshit programming, lets have a party with Coq.
git clone https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG
cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG
make

$ cat ~/.emacs
(load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/generic/proof-site")
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
(add-hook 'coq-mode-hook #'company-coq-mode)
(custom-set-variables '(package-selected-packages (quote (company-coq
company))))
(custom-set-faces)

Coq is best to be installed from opam, as opam coq deps found as requires in
coq files.
Coq codebase is maybe second after HOL/Isabell.
$ opam search coq | wc -l
     241

I use default emacs from brew
$ brew info emacs
emacs: stable 25.1 (bottled), devel 25.2-rc1, HEAD
