        <h3>CBOR/COSE encoding/protocol</h3>

        <h4>Annotation</h4>

        <p>CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) and
           COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption) are
           widely adopted in several standards published
           by organizations like ISO, IETF, FIPS, and others.
           Below is a list of relevant standards where CBOR
           and COSE are specified or heavily utilized.
        </p>

        <h3>1. IETF Standards (RFCs)</h3>

        <p>The IETF is one of the primary adopters of CBOR and COSE,
           with many RFCs dedicated to their definition and application.
          </p>

         <h4>1.1. CBOR Standards</h4>

         <p>
         <b>RFC 7049</b>: Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) – The foundational specification for CBOR.<br>
         <b>RFC 8949</b>: Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) – Updates and replaces RFC 7049 with clarifications and enhancements.<br>
         <b>RFC 8742</b>: Using CBOR for Extensible Protocols – Guidelines for using CBOR in extensible protocols.<br>
         </p>

         <h4>1.2. COSE Standards</h4>

<p>
<b>RFC 8152</b>: CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) – Defines COSE, a framework for signing, encryption, and message authentication.<br>
<b>RFC 9052</b>: CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE): Structures and Process – Updates and replaces RFC 8152.<br>
<b>RFC 8392</b>: CBOR Web Token (CWT) – Defines a compact token format using CBOR and COSE.<br>
<b>RFC 9338</b>: COSE and JOSE Algorithms – Registers cryptographic algorithms for COSE and JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE).<br>
</p>

         <h4>Applications and Protocols Using CBOR/COSE</h4>

         <p>
         <b>RFC 7252</b>: The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) – Uses CBOR as a serialization format for IoT devices.<br>
         <b>RFC 8927</b>: Entity Attestation Token (EAT) – Uses CBOR for encoding and COSE for secure signing of attestation tokens.<br>
         <b>RFC 9200</b>: Concise Problem Details for CoAP APIs – Standardizes problem details using CBOR.<br>
         </p>

        <h3>2. ISO Standards</h3>

<p>
<b>ISO/IEC 18013-5</b>: Mobile Driver's Licenses (mDL) – Uses CBOR for encoding data and COSE for securing mobile driver’s licenses.<br>
<b>ISO/IEC 23127-1</b>: CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) – Aligns with IETF standards for interoperability in secure communications.<br>
<b>ISO/IEC 19790</b>: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules – Includes COSE as a cryptographic standard for secure modules.<br>
</p>


        <h3>3. FIPS Standards</h3>

<p>While FIPS itself does not directly define CBOR or COSE, these standards are
referenced in FIPS-compliant systems due to their use of NIST-approved cryptographic algorithms:</p>

<p>
<b>FIPS 186-5</b>: Digital Signature Standard (DSS) – Indirectly supports COSE when using CBOR for signing with compliant algorithms.<br>
<b>FIPS 140-3</b>: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules – Cryptographic operations performed using COSE in CBOR-based applications must comply.<br>
</p>

        <h3>4. W3C Standards</h3>

<p>
Verifiable Credentials Data Model 1.1: Uses CBOR and COSE for encoding and signing credentials in constrained environments.<br>
Web of Things (WoT): Incorporates CBOR in WoT Thing Description and COSE for secure interactions.<br>
</p>

        <h3>5. IEEE Standards</h3>

<p>
<b>IEEE 802.15.4</b>: Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (LR-WPANs) – Uses CBOR for encoding in IoT-related communication protocols.<br>
<b>IEEE 1451</b>: Smart Transducer Interface Standards – Employs CBOR for compact data encoding and COSE for secure messaging.<br>
</p>

        <h3>6. Additional Protocols and Frameworks</h3>

<p>
<b>OMA LwM2M</b> (Lightweight M2M): Uses CBOR for encoding data and COSE for security in IoT device management.<br>
<b>DID</b> Core (Decentralized Identifiers): Includes support for CBOR and COSE for compact, secure identifier documents.<br>
<b>UAF</b> (FIDO Universal Authentication Framework): Leverages CBOR and COSE for secure, lightweight authentication in constrained environments.<br>
<b>EUDI</b> Framework: European Union Digital Identity Framework for digital documents.<br>
