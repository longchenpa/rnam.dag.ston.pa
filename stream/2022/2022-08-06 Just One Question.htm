    <h3>Just One Question</h3>

    <p> Personally, in 2018 I understood that a big war is coming, and left
        banking industry for Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine,
        to work on security of my country. I postponed PhD, scientific work,
        business, just about everything else. </p>

    <p> Right, this war for my family is going on for centuries:
        both of my grandpa's and a grandma were "Enemies of the People",
        and died in exile, or had to face a firing squad.
        My father (aged 5!) was declared "Enemy of the People" and
        exiled to Arkhangelsk.</p>

    <p> What you see now on TV was already lived through by my family
        in the last century, more than once. </p>
 
    <p> If you think Ukrainians might be surprised by rapes of 3-year olds,
        or by bayonetted pregnant women, you know nothing about Ukraine.
        My parents were going mad from hunger, yet became university
        professors. I am grateful to them for flawless ethics education. </p>

    <p> We know how to quickly and painlessly commit suicide if captured,
        we know your thinking in every detail. We know how to wage a war
        on you, and to the last breath will do this, for the coming 300
        years at least. </p>

    <p> You can spit out words in whatever order, but we only look at your actions. </p>

    <p> For every educated person, the source of the State power are the citizens.
        As they pay taxes, they are responsible for everything that follows.
        This is known since Aristotle times. </p>

    <p> Just one question: how much tax have you personally
        paid since you were born? </p>
