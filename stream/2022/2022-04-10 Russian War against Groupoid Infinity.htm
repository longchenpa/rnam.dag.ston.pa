        <h3>Russian War against Groupoid Infinity</h3>

        <h3>Invitation</h3>

        <p>This war must be won on the battlefield (c) Josep Borrell</p>

        <p><a href="https://gist.github.com/forked-from-1kasper/06d241303cc314b35c291c38e61a5e0c?fbclid=IwAR1T9-lp8Uo3e-yHBUIzW4yyWVSBi_AnJJAUJEHJSnpG8N2v2k40hSTFnYM">Attack at Gihub Gists</a><br>

       </p>

        <p>I have tons of evidence from #CHLOR channel where russian fascism took its place,
           @forked-from-1kasper was intentionally humiliating ukrainians
           under the nickname of Hitler after a series of warnings.
           Think of that choice. BRATISLAVA is @Borschemancer and justperson is @slaykovsky,
           the @facebook employee.</p>

       <p><a href="https://github.com/groupoid/anders/blob/main/ACKNOWLEDGEMENT#L6">ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</a>

       <p>I think these accounts should be banned from @github permanently or
          <a href="https://tonpa.guru/stream/2022/2022-03-15%20Github%20supports%20Russian%20Fascism.htm">Github
          Supports Russian Fascism</a></p>

        <h3>To whom it may concern</h3>

       <p>To understand Anders/OCaml history you can obtain <b>EXE</b> code by performing:</p>

<figure><code>
git clone https://github.com/5HT/exe-archive

</code></figure>

<p>This is very first prototype of syntax and initial point of Anders/Erlang, full code:</p>

<figure><code>
├── README.md
├── priv
│   ├── cubical.syntax
│   ├── inductive.ctt
│   ├── mltt.ctt
│   └── trunc.ctt
├── rebar.config
├── src
│   ├── cub.app.src
│   ├── cub.erl
│   ├── cub_lexer.xrl
│   ├── cub_parser.yrl
│   └── macro.erl
└── sys.config

</code></figure>

<p>Nobody did this except me as you see by commits. Andy was learning HoTT by
   implementing Awodey's Impredicative Encoding which is now part of Anders/OCaml
   library. Paul was working on Lean modeling and previous <b>EXE</b> syntax that
   has nothing common with <b>cubicaltt</b>, which is reference point for Anders/OCaml,
   so Paul' code was removed. Denys was learning cubicaltt with System-F realization
   of recursive schemes, which was excluded from Anders,
   <a href="https://github.com/mortberg/cubicaltt/commits?author=5HT">but included
   by me in cubicaltt</a>. Other contributors were proofreaders.</p>

<p>This person @forked-from-1kasper is writing letters to Henk Barendregt,
   tagging famous mathematicians on twitter, trying to discredit, attacking
   on Ukrainian mathematical community Groupoid Infinity. Uneffectfully.
   This is insane behavior in the middle of war with Ukraine. I have many
   tasks here in developing products for Ukrainian Government in position
   of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sokhatsky/">Enterprise Architect</a>,
   this is just another attack surface in Great Patriotic War. Also I have the
   dignity and duty to protect Groupoid Infinity from russian attacks.</p>

<p>The presentation of my <a href="https://github.com/groupoid/CCHM">CCHM</a>
   library was made in CMU in 2019, long before Anders was started. I decided
   to switch to OCaml version and invited @forked-from-1kasper to my repositories.
   ISC License with this little fascist <a href="https://github.com/forked-from-1kasper/anders/commit/32a9f345c2d6095b21c9c0785c95d8ab19bf992b">was
   added by me only in 6 JUL 2021 as a gift</a>, <b>after</b> Anders release.
   Only from that point he can start pretending to something and only in US
   jurisdiction, while Groupoid Infinity has Ukrainian jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Anders/OCaml was funded by Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and
   Synrc Research Center. I'm the sole copyright holder of <a href="https://n2o.dev/">N2O.DEV</a>
   and <a href="https://erp.uno/">ERP.UNO</a> the main products of Synrc
   Research (Yes, I manage alone 77 Github repositories).
   Synrc Research operates since 2005 and my code is powering
   <a href="https://deposits.privatbank.ua/static/doc/index.htm">PrivatBank</a>,
   the biggest bank in Eastern Europe with 30 millions of retail subscribers,
   MIA products and its infrastructure,
   <a href="https://gonynja.com/">messaging platforms</a>, and many more
   small businesses. But also it powers russian and blockchain businesses.
   After Full Scale War of russian orks against The Brave People of Dignity
   I'm changing licenses of all my repositories to
   <a href="https://5ht.co/license/">DHARMA LICENSE</a> to aviod this
   ridicuouls misundestanding of General Ethics. From now on my code
   will not power any russians or blockchains.</p>

<p>Anders is a product of Synrc Research that was started for the sake
   of formalization of enterprise protocols and modalities (Guarded Cubical,
   Flat, de Rham and other modalities). Our specification of
  <a href="https://ws.n2o.dev/">N2O</a>,
  <a href="https://kvs.n2o.dev/">KVS</a>,
  <a href="https://bpe.n2o.dev/">BPE</a> and
  <a href="https://nitro.n2o.dev/">NITRO</a>
  libraries <a href="https://n2o.dev/pro/index.html">is given in Anders language</a>.
  At the bottom of the page you can obtain companies who use our technologies.
  Our stack is available for most functional languages: <a href="https://n2o.dev/tech/">N2O.SPACE</a>
  The full picture is rendered in my PhD dissertation:</p>

* <a href="https://formal.uno/monography.pdf">Groupoid Infinity FORMAL.UNO monography.pdf</a>
</p>

<p>We are considering here this is as an attack to our infrastructure,
   our reputation and our merits! All Anders articles and educational
   materials were written by myself alone. I claim I can implement
   Anders in any language in 1 week. Invite me on your site and I will prove that.</p>

        <h3>To young fascist</h3>

        <p>Nikolai Myshko, you're young fascist and you can't change the fact that you
           were sponsoring and supporting the war. I will tell all the
           truth about you, how you behaved in #CHLOR chats. About KHOHOLS
           and N-words you used, about humiliation and jokes about LGBTQ+ community.</p>

        <p>No one was ever hired to develop EXE or HTS languages, this is fake.
           I paid little money to @zraffer for OM support and that's it.
           I added you to license and I removed. These are my projects,
           I can freely change this as I want. More than half of this
           information is fake russian propaganda and spreading misinformation
           about me which he replicates all over the Internet, trying to
           steal my accounts, unsuccessfully. You can ask directly to @zraffer
           and @nponeccop what code they wrote and where it is placed in repository.</p>

        <p>Disgusting that I need to explain in public because of some young ruscist,
           while we have a full scale war. You have all history records, fork,
           rewrite everything, put your license and live with that in your fascist russia.
           How you can tell me what to do with my repositories? Insane russian imperialism!</p>

        <p>All my works at @Github from now on are licenced under the terms of
           <a href="https://5ht.co/license/">DHARMA LICENSE</a>. This is not ISC,
           this is new license. Please respect that!</p>

        <figure><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/144776/162596330-905a8f46-ac9d-49a2-869c-e3ec41a1dd2d.png"></figure>

       <p>Once this young ruscist was my student, I taught him Modal HoTT after
          visiting <a href="https://tonpa.guru/stream/2019/2019-03-16%20Geometry%20in%20Modal%20HoTT.htm">Geometry in Modal HoTT workshop</a>
       </p>

       <p>Now he is saying that everything he made was made by him alone, very funny.
          Not that it matters, I don't give a fuck, just small notice.
          I literally spend the same amount of time, and even
          have <a href="https://github.com/forked-from-1kasper/anders/graphs/contributors">more
          commits in his fork than him</a> and this is only in OCaml repo,
          disregarding <a href="https://HOMOTOPY.DEV">HOMOTOPY.DEV</a>
          homotopy library site and files homepages! You can compare this amount of
          work with your favourite communist-labeled provers or Arend sites.</p>

       <p>"This library contained some original code and I was curious to find out
          where it came from." Did you manage to investigate where my code came from?
          You calling me liar but there is no
          evidence <a href="https://github.com/5HT/exe-archive">EXE</a> code
          was written by anyone execpt me, full history 848 commits. As I said
          you can ask directly to @zraffer and @nponeccop about their contribution.
          @zraffer was working mainly
          on <a href="https://github.com/nponeccop/om/tree/master/priv/posets">poset</a>
          and <a href="https://github.com/nponeccop/om/tree/master/priv/setoids">setoid</a>
          encodings which were later completly removed from <a href="https://github.com/nponeccop/om">OM</a>
          repository as non-finished. @nponeccop was paid only several
          times for <a href="https://github.com/nponeccop/n2o.hs/">N2O.HS</a>
          port which was later substituted by work of @xafizoff <a href="https://github.com/o3/n2o">O3/N2O</a>.
          But that was not even donation, Andy is a rich person, that was
          my declaration of intention to make something together. That is the truth.
          You are the person who is spreading misinformation about me for 44 days
          starting from day 1 of our Great Patriotic War. I'm still fighting in
          twitter with trolls from your #CHLOR channel. That is you who called
          us KHOHOLS on our HOMOTOPY.DEV channel publicly, and just after that
          incident you were immediately banned for CoC violation and for recognized
          fascist support at your #CHLOR channel. That is the truth. I already told
          you all of that. Your contribution will be completely swiped out.</p>

       <p>I don't even know if this person is real or some FSS account that was
          implanted to @groupoid to hijack Ukrainian mathematical community.
          Pity that @Github still not baning russian accounts, that are thretening
          Ukrainians, but providing a platform for further spreading of misinformation.</p>

       <p>I just want you all to know that I'm 41 and I already finished my
          academical track record. I'm retired, I'm a teacher of Tibetan Buddhism,
          I have officialy registered religious organization @longchenpa here in
          Ukraine. He is maybe thinking that I'm like him 19 y.o. who want to have
          text battles in Internet. This is not true, you can see my public life
          in all social networks, I have a rich beautiful fulfilled life, which
          you probably hate.</p>

        </p>

       <p>The academia for me always was a hobby and sport
          for thinking, managing around 100 github repositories is not an easy task.
          I have in average 1500-5000 commits per year for last 10 years continuously,
          which means I can easily get TOP-10 Github contributors in
          any <a href="https://commits.top">state around the world</a>,
          including China, Brazil, California (USA) and Russia.</p>

       <p>In next life I don't want to be born like famous mathematician,
          I want to be born like regular Ukrainian. Now I'm just trying to protect
          my students from these barbarian people.</p>

       <p>A person who lives only with thoughts about mathematics, without
          a spouse, pets, a healthy environment, healthy food, ordinary human things,
          is most likely at least internally predisposed to a distorted perception
          of reality, and at the maximum is a suitable vessel for propaganda.
          Sociopathic predisposition seasoned with mathematical logic gives
          rise to truly monstrous images of stalking, which will only serve
          their own internal unknown purposes and will not reflect society's demands
          for mercy and ethics, or even the usual educational minimum.</p>

       <p>The man who decided to attack me during the war, in which his
          compatriots kill and rape our women and children, and that the worst
          thing rapes our babies and sell video with this on the black market,
          when they burn our civilians in mobile crematorias, I don’t say
          anymore about ordinary massacres and looting, at that time he is
          only interested in the Github commits of my repositories, which
          he wrote under my direction, has obviously become on the side of evil,
          and the only correct solution in this case is to completely put
          this person outside of my reality.</p>

       <p>Have a nice investigation!<br>
          With honour, proud to be Ukrainian,
          yours <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7127-8796">Namdak Tonpa</a></p>

        <h3>To LGBTQ+ mathematicians</h3>

       <p>Being non-binary I want to live in a world where during war
          in the center of Europe in which russians rape our women and
          children, and babies(!), burn our civilians in mobile crematorias,
          not to say ordinary massacres and looting, the western so called
          "civilzation" woudn't be silent.</p>

       <p>I just think HoTT community is too good to some uneducated freaked KHOHOLS from Ukraine,
          with such astoning leaders as neo-comminits and jewish russian supporters.
          So I'd better choose to die now at war then ever visit any HoTT workshops
          or conferences in the future. I just not good enough to understand your ethics and
          your civilization. Do you hear that? I hear only silcence of money transfer
          in $1 billion transaction a day for 45 days of Germany is paying
          for <a href="https://bloody.energy/">russian bloody energy</a>.</p>

       <p>And these people are reading Grothendieck. Do you know that his
          father was born in Ukraine at a time? The Grothendieck who visit
          Vietnam at war would roll over in his grave by observing this serpentarium.</p>

       <p>You have a problem in western civilization, especially in world education.
          This is like schizophrenia, when you make from small thing a big thing
          artificially. Just compare the numbers of jewish people vs ukranians
          that were exterminated during world Genocides. Your education is wasted completely.<p>

       <p>You all should better try to stop killing Ukrainians right now,
          the counter renders tens of millions. If "civilization" is silent
          about killing millions of white people you hate while it's being
          broadcast online, why would you expect it to care about
          killing people of other races or flavours? You are really
          disgusting people. Wake up "civilization", you are nearly dead.</p>
