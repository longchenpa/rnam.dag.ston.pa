            <h3>Erlang Hospitality and Hostility</h3>
            <h4></h4>

            <p>
             Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/rvirding">@rvirding</a>,
             <a href="https://twitter.com/joeerl">@joeerl</a>, you have created a disgusting community, worst ever.
             You are like Philip Wadler who is selling his soul for scaling Ponzi schemes
             with byzantine generals, except you're sellling ignorance to young people.
             I'm talking directly to <a href="https://twitter.com/joeerl">@joeerl</a> R.I.P. because nobody want to talk with me in your
             condescend Erlang community. I remember back in 2011 Erlang Factory repast
             where Joe asked me what actually we are "researching" at our SYNRC (condescend),
             I answered "languages". But later I figured out that Erlang community doesn't
             need languages (nobody can even finish a toy ML port like Alpaca, Gleam, Caramel, Purerl, Rufus and other experiments).
             What it needs is just a bunch of kids transforming JSON from one REST endpoint to another.
             Erlang frameworks were abandoned in the same way: BeepBeep, Erlang Web, Chicago Boss, Nitrogen everything was suspended in 2016.
             ESL is backed as body-selling outsource shop with lowest possible level of engineers.
             You're selling books about abandoned Nitrogen with closed eyes on that N2O is Nitrogen 2x Optimized,
             being just another its implementation with analytic extension to enterprise services.
            </p>

            <p>Not that I really care your Erlang Serpentarium, I dropped officially
               your bullshit at 2015 and moved on. While I'm writing this, some
               child AstonJ from <a href="https://erlangforums.com/t/hamler-have-you-used-it/180">Erlang Forums</a>
               is deleting my messages. Hope <a href="https://twitter.com/joeerl">@joeerl</a> see it. You're so self-played
               in monopoly that totally forgot about if not ethical then maybe sport-oriented fair-game rules, please.
            </p>

            <p>By the way SYNRC is the biggest ecosystem yet in Erlang/Elixir world with
              its own Virtual Machine <a href="https://github.com/cloudozer/ling">LING</a> that
              powered <a href="https://github.com/FlowForwarding/lincx">LINCX</a> (Erlang on Xen SDN-switch by Infoblox)
              and gave spin-off to the series of other BEAM implementations.
              We have 64 packages in <a href="https://hex.pm/users/5ht">hex.pm/users/5HT</a>, 43025977
              tracked downloads, 20 authors and full ignorance in official Eralng
              world because they (ESL/EEF) have seen us as Phoenix competitor.
              We have even our own package manager <a href="https://github.com/synrc/mad">MAD</a> (built for LING purposes) but
              my letters about adding it to HEX.PM was ignored and I was forced to promote all my packages to rebar3 and mix,
              nobody wants another package manager support in HEX.PM. For them this is not the community &mdash;
              this is the cold mindkilling business. Go get more kids, maybe then you will be able to
              reproduce the true success of Go!</p>

            <figure><img src="img/wflikes.png" width=800></figure>

            <p>From my side I will guard Eastern Europe from ESL/EEF bullshit. While I'm in Ukraine
               I can guarantee that you will never be in this market here on dominant positions.
               Just because if you put Phoenix and N2O at the deep research level,
               everybody will found to chose N2O.</p>

            <p>The only Phoenix solution in Ukrainian government
               is <a href="https://twitter.com/5HT/status/1318577778011164672">eHealth</a> project which
               has terrible footprint and scalability issues. N2O on the other hand is not just a library, it powers
               the biggest eastern european bank for 30M subscribers and has real fullstack
               up to Business X-Forms layer, BPMN layer and protocol generators (JS/Swift/Java/Protobuf/BERT).
               Something Elixir community will lack for years. That is the situation here, you have poisoned
               with Phoenix a part of my country just because it was started and implemented
               by imbeciles &mdash; your target user audience.</p>

            <p>Basically where you're wrong: you're trying to sell information system consulting
               in distributed systems field by creating frameworks for imbeciles and trying to
               create business on them. That will always fail. By short scrolling of ESL/EEF stream
               I found that ESL/EEF basically sold themselves to aeternity, which is driven by
               narc-addicted non-adequate. Not surprised here:</p>

              <center>BLOCKCHAIN + PHOENIX = <3</center>

             <p>Selling Ponzi schemes and pumping companies with staff FTW!</p>

             <p>Anything that will ever be released in Elixir/Phoenix already presented
                with deployments in SYNRC/N2O. Including (but not limited to) dependently
                typed language <a href="https://henk.groupoid.space">PTS</a>, cubical HoTT typechecker
                <a href="https://anders.groupoid.space">HTS</a> and
                chain replication database <a href="https://n2o.dev/articles/cr.htm">CR</a>.
                You just will never catch us with people who recreating
                REST libraries for 10 years with no visible success. They can't even
                learn how to use mnesia. These kids undestand only PostgreSQL,
                JSON, REST (holy trinity for orthodox russians). Everything beyond that vision is taken as hostile.
                If you think banning biggest contributors will not have consequences you're wrong!</p>

              <p>Though, Thank you for banning me from your community! I will appreciate this forever!</p>
