    <h3>HoTT community supports Russian Fascism</h3>

    <h4>The HoTT language usually used in HoTT community</h4>

    <p>When I had send a letter to a HoTT community about russian invasion
       I got banned and message deleted. I saw Brasilian HoTT members
       wishing Ukrainians got bombed in  Feb 2022. I'm fine with shutdown
       homotopy grants for Emily Riehl who collaborates with fascist Nikolai Fizruk Kudasov.
       That is called Karma. The Agda cubical is ugly bullshit driven by
       incompetent students with no engineering skills. Mathematical
       retards I call them.</p>

    <p>Our HoTT team members are serving in Armed Forces of Ukraine.
       They will never talk or shake hands with you.</p>

    <p>Homotopy Theory didn't start from Voevodsky, it was started by
       Michael Warren and young students who were driving the subject.
       Fascist Retard Voevodsky didn't break down Univalence. It became
       possible only after 2016 by Swedish people. USA created just
       bullshit cartesian clone.</p>

    <p>HoTT community is a bunch of uneducated children with no ethics
       and jokes about people with limited abilities from Steve Awodey.
       Now I understand Kevin Buzzard.</p>

    <p>Just for accounting. Emily Riehl Grant is about 400 000 USD.
       Let me tell you how we do science in Ukraine. I need to gather
       50 000 USD by myself to fund my own research and visit all
       conferences with my own money. On the other hand Andromeda project funded by
       USA grant FA9550-14-1-0096 has as achievement the natural number
       in Church encoding (I'm wondering how much it takes to develop and costs)
       while it's author blaming me to have very little contribution to CCHM at
       Proof Assistants Stack Exchange.</p>

    <p>Having fastest cubical type checker on the planet I received no
       mentions in analogical works, like Andras Kovacs, who also works
       with fascists like Vladislav Zavialov, they have no so fast
       typechecker claiming it is fast :-) Another mathematical retards
       lost in SGA4 like wannabe communist without education Jon Sterling.</p>

    <p>This is not science. This is children's playground.</p>

    <h4>The translation from Ukrainian to English</h4>

    <p>I would like to express my concerns about certain aspects of the
       Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) community. When I attempted to discuss
       the Russian invasion with a HoTT group, my message was deleted,
       and I was banned. At the same time, I have seen members from
       Brazil making deeply inappropriate remarks about Ukraine in
       February 2022. Given these experiences, I find it difficult
       to support funding initiatives for researchers who collaborate
       with individuals engaged in unethical behavior.</p>

    <p>Regarding the development of HoTT, it is important to acknowledge
       that contributions to the field have come from many individuals.
       While Vladimir Voevodsky played a major role in popularizing
       Univalence, substantial progress was made after 2016,
       particularly by Swedish researchers. The mathematical
       foundations of HoTT were not solely built by one person
       but rather by a broader community of early contributors.</p>

    <p>Moreover, I am concerned about the lack of recognition
       for significant technical achievements. For example,
       despite having developed the fastest cubical type checker,
       my work has not been acknowledged in related research.
       In contrast, projects such as András Kovács' type checker,
       which is not as fast, receive more attention. This raises
       broader questions about fairness and transparency in academic citation practices.</p>

    <p>Finally, I want to highlight the differences in research funding
       structures. In Ukraine, researchers often need to secure their
       own funding for projects and conference travel. Meanwhile,
       grants in other countries, such as the U.S., provide
       substantial financial support to researchers, sometimes
       exceeding hundreds of thousands of dollars. These disparities
       create challenges for those outside well-funded institutions.</p>

    <p>I hope for a more ethical, inclusive, and merit-based approach
       in both the academic and research communities.</p>
